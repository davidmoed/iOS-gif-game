# CONTRIBUTING

Managing git repositories can be hard, so we've laid out a few simple guidelines to help keep things organized.

### Guidelines

1. Create a **Pull Request**; instead of pushing directly to `master`.

2. Give your branch a **descriptive name** like `dh-network-fix` instead of something ambiguous like `my-branch`.

3. Write a **descriptive summary** in the comment section on Github.

4. **Don't merge your own Pull Request**; send it to your teammate for review.

5. If you think something could be improved: **write a comment on the Pull Request** and send it to the author.

6. Make sure your branch is based off `master`, and not some other outdated branch.

7. **Don't reuse branches.** Once they're merged to `master` you should consider deleting them.

8. Prefer **squash** when doing a **Pull Request**, as it simplifies the commit history.
