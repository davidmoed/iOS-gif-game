# GIF GAME FOR IOS

We are creating a game like "Apples to Apples" or "What Do You Meme," a card game that allows users to compete each round to best match their card to a given prompt. Our twist, instead of normal cards we use GIFS, which are both way more fun, and more engaging!

We are creating this project for our final assignment in our iOS class.


### How will it work?
GIF Game will integrate the Giphy and Facebook SDKs to help with functionality and authentication, in addition to connecting to a user's phone contacts to link users to their friends.

The Giphy SDK will allow GIF Game to access a huge library of GIFS that will keep the game fresh, with constantly updating GIFS, and control the tags associated with each GIF that's loaded to ensure that they are appropriate and not too weird.

The Facebook SDK will allow users to Authenticate via Facebook, and play the game with Facebook friends once they have connected.


### Who would play?

Anyone who likes GIFS, has an iPhone, and has friends!

### How do you play?

After logging in and connecting with friends, a user enters a game. Each game has 4 players and runs for 7 rounds.

Each player is dealt 7 GIFS at the beginning of the game, and one player is chosen as the judge for the first round. At the beginning of a round a topic is shown to all players, and each of the players (with the exception of the judge) chooses a GIF to submit. Once all GIFS are submitted, everyone playing is shown all the entries for that round, and the judge chooses the winner. The winner is awarded a point, and becomes the judge for the next round. After 7 rounds (or more, this is the default amount), the player with the most points is the winner!
